    <h1>Lasagna!</h1>
    <p>An overview of how to make an lasagna - Feeds 4 people (at least!)</p>
    
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>500 g</strong> minced meat (beef)</li>
            <li><strong>4 cans</strong> tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>3 tsp</strong> tomato paste</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> large onions</li>
            <li><strong>5 cloves</strong> garlic</li>
            <li><strong>250 ml</strong> broth (any kind)</li>
            <li><strong>250 ml</strong> mornay sauce</li>
            <li><strong>1-2 packages</strong> of pasta plates</li>
            <li>cheese for topping of the lasagna</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="recipeDescription">
        <ol>
            <li>Finely dice the onions, and thinly slice garlic. Put aside.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pot. Fry the minced meat in smaller portions* till it is golden brown. Transfer browned meat to a bowl</li>
            <li>In the same pot add onions (and oil if need be). Stir them until they become slightly translucent. Add garlic and let them simmer for about a minute. Add tomato paste and stir.
                add canned tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>Add broth. Let it simmer for half an hour - stiring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add back the minced meat. Let it come back to temperature, while you season it to taste with pepper, salt, and italian herbs (e.g thyme).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees celcius</li>
            <li>In a ovenproof dish alternate layers of beef-tomato sauce, pasta plates, mornay sauce. For the final layer top pastaplates with mornay sauce and cheese.</li>
            <li>Pop the dish in the oven and bake for 45 min, or until the cheese starts to bubble and brown.</li>
            <li>Take the dish out of the oven and let it cool for half and hour on the stovetop.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>* - It is important not to crowd the bottom of the pot, as that tends to boil the meat instead of frying it. Depending on the potsize 125g is usually a good split to ensure it doesn't boil</p>
