    <h1>Basic dough</h1>
    <p>The essiential idea to make a good dough</p>
    
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>500 g</strong> flour</li>
            <li><strong>360 ml</strong> tepid water</li>
            <li><strong>15 g</strong> fresh yeast - <em>or</em> <strong>7.5 g</strong> dry yeast.</li>
            <li><strong>10-15 g</strong> salt</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="recipeDescription">
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl mix flour and salt</li>
            <li>Disolve the yeast in the water</li>
            <li>Add the yeasty water to the large bowl</li>
            <li>Mix until combined. Let it rest for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>To knead the dough, either knead it continuosly until it passes the windowpane test*, or for 3-5min every half hour until it passes the test</li>
            <li>Once it passes the test, either put it in the fridge overnight:
                <ul><li>Take it out of the fridge, but it in a baking form or shape it to your desire. Let it come to room temp (roughly 30 min)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Or if you're planning to bake it right away, let it rise to double size.
                <ul><li>Shape it into the desired form (or put into a baking form). Let it rise for 20minutes</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 225+ degrees celcius.</li>
            <li>Have one shallow baking sheet in the oven for water (below), and another for the bread to sit on (on-top)</li>
            <li>In a kettle boil 500ml water. Put the bread in the oven, and add a large splash of water to the baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-50 min depending on the shape of the loaf. To check if it is done, tap the underside of the bread. If it sounds hollow, it is done</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and let it rest until it is roughly room temperature (slighty warmer is acceptable)</li>
            
        </ol>
        <p>* - The windowpane test is performed by grabbing the dough and letting it stretch out by its own weight. If the dough holds together until the you can glimpse light and your finger behind it, without tearing, it is ready.</p>
